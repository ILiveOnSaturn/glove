it seems that i cannot use tensorflow with micro controllers together with circuitpython, or at least not in an easy way, so for now i will use the opportunity and code everything in c/c++.
i will use the pico sdk and tflite-micro generator to build the project. (https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-tflmicro, https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro)
with the imu i have 2 options, write a new interface or use the one written for me by the ebay guy, only problem is that its written for arduino, so ill need to check.
for hid interface, ill use tinyusb, as its the only option i have, even though the documentations are nearly empty. ill have to learn from the examples or some weird tutorial online. make sure you learn about DEVICE MODE and not host mode. (https://docs.tinyusb.org/en/latest/reference/getting_started.html)
i need to learn how to use cmake since it seems ill be using it for this project.
why is c so hellish?

i tried to make the onboard code ready but there is no way of knowing without building the glove, oh well.

i just tried to make the save function in the training program and i realized that i need to rethink about how the array works. fix this.

i am figuring out little by little how tiny usb works. its kinda cool once u know it. basically there is a config file and a descriptor file and rn im currently in the config file so there are a bunch of defines and stuff. the only thing im having a hard time figuring out is the rhport.
ok so rhport is basically for boards who have multiple usb connections and its used to choose which port i want to use. ig ill go with port 0 for now.
